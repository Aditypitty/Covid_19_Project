# Covid_19_Project
 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization Project
This project provides an in-depth exploration of COVID-19 data across multiple countries, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and active cases. The goal is to analyze trends, compare country-level impacts, and visualize the spread of the virus using both static and interactive plots.

📁 Project Overview
In this notebook, I:

Loaded and processed a COVID-19 dataset (likely sourced from John Hopkins / Kaggle).

Cleaned and transformed the dataset for time series and country-wise analysis.

Reshaped data using pandas.melt() for multi-country comparisons.

Plotted:

✅ Line plots of confirmed cases over time for selected countries

✅ Point plots of country-level cases for visual clarity

✅ Interactive choropleth maps to display active and death cases by country

🌍 Countries Analyzed
United States

India

Brazil

France

Russia

These countries were selected due to their large case counts and diverse outbreak patterns.

📊 Visualizations Used
matplotlib & seaborn for:

Time series line plots

Categorical point plots

plotly.express for:

Choropleth maps of Active and Death cases

Interactive country-level insights

🧰 Libraries Used
